    "how_to_use": "Follow all directions on your prescription label and read all medication guides or instruction sheets. Your doctor may occasionally change your dose. Use the medicine exactly as directed. You may take levetiracetam oral with or without food. Levetiracetam injection is given into a vein by a healthcare provider. Your dose needs may change if you switch to a different brand, strength, or form of this medicine. Avoid medication errors by using exactly as directed on the label, or as prescribed by your doctor. Doses are based on weight in children and teenagers. Your child's dose may change if the child gains or loses weight. Measure liquid medicine with the supplied measuring device (not a kitchen spoon). Swallow the tablet whole and do not crush or chew it. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are unable to swallow a whole tablet. Do not use a tablet that is damaged in any way. Read and carefully follow any Instructions for Use provided to you on how to prepare and take levetiracetam tablet for oral suspension. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you do not understand these instructions. Part of the extended-release tablet may appear in your stool, but this will not make the medicine less effective. Your kidney function and blood pressure may need to be checked often. Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider. Seizures may increase if you stop using levetiracetam suddenly. Ask your doctor before stopping the medicine. Follow your doctor's instructions about tapering your dose.",
