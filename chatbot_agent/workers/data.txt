Whats in my report ? Is everything okay in the report ? Whats wrong in the report ? What are the Abnormalities 
The Summarized Report of the patient is: 
1. Findings:
- The patient, John Doe, underwent ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) for suspected White-Coat Hypertension.
- A total of 35 blood pressure readings were taken, with 85% of them being valid.    
- The summary of blood pressure readings showed elevated values during the daytime, nighttime, and over a 24-hour period.

2. Abnormal values/Health concerns:
- Daytime blood pressure was 142/87 mmHg, which is higher than the normal range of <135/85 mmHg.
- Nighttime blood pressure was 125/75 mmHg, exceeding the normal range of <120/70 mmHg.
- The 24-hour blood pressure was 135/85 mmHg, higher than the normal range of <130/80 mmHg.
- The interpretation suggests elevated ambulatory blood pressure consistent with sustained hypertension, indicating the need for treatment.

3. Explanation of complex terms:
- Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM): A test that measures blood pressure at regular intervals over a 24-hour period, providing a more accurate assessment of blood pressure variations throughout the day and night.
- White-Coat Hypertension: A condition where a person's blood pressure is higher in a medical setting (doctor's office) than in other settings, leading to a false diagnosis of hypertension.
- Sustained hypertension: Persistent high blood pressure readings over time, indicating a need for ongoing treatment to manage blood pressure levels.
